# Russian Roulette

This party game is modeled after Russian Roulette. Choose to spin the chamber once at the start (maximum of six turns) or spin after each turn (always a 1/6th chance). If you're "shot", you'll face incredibly loud music intended to give you just as much pain as actually dying.

We would recommend playing this in a physical setting, each player passing around the phone connected to a pair of (optionally really shitty) earbuds. When you click the button to fire the gun, sit on your hands so you're subjected to as much music as your reaction time can allow for.
